#### *Stock Market Prediction to the future share values based on values of previous time instances using the data of AAPL from tiingo app : https://www.tiingo.com*
  #### *The task can be represented as a sequence modelling with the application of Deep Neural Network, including stacked layers of LSTMs to extract useful features and contexts between previous instances and a dense layer as a function approximator to the predicted outputs*
  #### *Finally, The proposed approach introduces its own vision and expectations for the market share values in the upcoming month provided with detailed graphs for the time series forecasting as we can see below*![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75932105/208234273-2ccfd536-7232-4ff5-bce3-b3db0b4c7a02.png)
