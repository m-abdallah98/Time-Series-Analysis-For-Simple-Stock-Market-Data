#### *Stock Market Prediction to the future share values based on values of previous time instances using the data of AAPL from tiingo app : https://www.tiingo.com*
  #### *The task can be represented as a sequence modelling with the application of Deep Neural Network, including stacked layers of LSTMs to extract useful features and contexts between previous instances and a dense layer as a function approximator to the predicted outputs*
  #### *Finally, The proposed approach introduces its own vision and expectations for the market share values in the upcoming month provided with detailed graphs for the time series forecasting*
